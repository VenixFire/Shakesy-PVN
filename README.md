  To install and play this video game prototype:
    
      Download and Install Ren'Py Visual Novel Engine v8.4.1: https://www.renpy.org 

      Once this is installed, move to your filesystem (Finder, if apple. File Explorer if windows)
      In your filesystem find where you installed Ren'Py, the default is usually downloads, but I like to install into Documents.

      Once you find the folder "renpy-8.4.1-sdk" you can download the code from this GitHub by clicking the "<> Code" Button and clicking Download ZIP. 

      Unzip the file from Downloads into the "renpy-8.4.1-sdk" folder. 

      Open Ren'py and look for the project on the left side of the screen. Click the project then click "Launch Project" in the bottom right corner.
