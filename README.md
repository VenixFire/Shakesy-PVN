  A downloadable distribution can be found in the "Full Game Zips" folder. If you want to play the game, you can download this repo using the "<> Code" button and pressing "Download Zip". Once you unzip the game files, you can access the "Full Game Zips" folder and upzip the version made for your computer (Windows or Mac, if you want a linux dist I can get one for you :)). Use the .exe or whatever the mac does (I haven't actually tested the mac version.)
  
  To install and play this video game prototype:
    
      Download and Install Ren'Py Visual Novel Engine v8.4.1: https://www.renpy.org 

      Once this is installed, move to your filesystem (Finder, if apple. File Explorer if windows)
      In your filesystem find where you installed Ren'Py, the default is usually downloads, but I like to install into Documents.

      Once you find the folder "renpy-8.4.1-sdk" you can download the code from this GitHub by clicking the "<> Code" Button and clicking Download ZIP. 

      Unzip the file from Downloads into the "renpy-8.4.1-sdk" folder. 

      Open Ren'py and look for the project on the left side of the screen. Click the project then click "Launch Project" in the bottom right corner.
